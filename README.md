### Introduction：
This work proposes a weakly supervised approach for 3D object detection, only requiring a small set of weakly annotated scenes, associated with a few precisely labeled object instances. This is achieved by a two-stage architecture design. Using only 500 weakly annotated scenes and 534 precisely labeled vehicle instances, our method achieves 85−95% the performance of current top-leading, fully supervised detectors (which require 3, 712 exhaustively and precisely annotated scenes with 15, 654 instances). More importantly, our trained model can be applied as a 3D object annotator, generating annotations which can be used to train 3D object detectors with over 94% of their original performance (under manually labeled data). Above designs make our approach highly practical and introduce new opportunities for learning 3D object detection with reduced annotation burden.
