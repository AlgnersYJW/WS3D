=======================================================

### Introduction：
This work proposes a weakly supervised approach for 3D object detection, only requiring a small set of weakly annotated scenes, associated with a few precisely labeled object instances. This is achieved by a two-stage architecture design. Using only 500 weakly annotated scenes and 534 precisely labeled vehicle instances, our method achieves 85−95% the performance of current top-leading, fully supervised detectors (which require 3, 712 exhaustively and precisely annotated scenes with 15, 654 instances). More importantly, our trained model can be applied as a 3D object annotator, generating annotations which can be used to train 3D object detectors with over 94% of their original performance (under manually labeled data). Above designs make our approach highly practical and introduce new opportunities for learning 3D object detection with reduced annotation burden.

The code will be released soon.
